# Background and acknowledgments

Should I call this directory "dotfiles" for the sake of congruency with others' repositories, even though it does a lot more than manage some files whose names start with a period?

I liked [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)'s "topical" strategy of segregating configurations into directories for various areas that you might want to install together. I think I will go a bit further and make a system to enable or disable topics similar to Apache's `a2ensite` and related commands. Only in Apache, you install modules and then can enabled or disable them, whereas here it seems to make more sense to enable modules so you can then install (and uninstall?) them. I guess installing should be tied to enabling since there doesn't seem a point in only enabling.
